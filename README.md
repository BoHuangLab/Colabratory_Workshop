Yina Wang and David Brown
2019

## The first Huang lab colabratory workshop

- Originally we tested this for viewing microscopy images.
- It has since been used for primer design using the Mammalian Tool Kit (MTK) system.
- Rasmi has now made some improvements towards an automated microscopy image viewer for our bespoke microscope "Yosemite".
